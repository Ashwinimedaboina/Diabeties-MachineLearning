1. Diabetes Data Analysis

This repository contains a project for analyzing a diabetes dataset. The goal is to explore the data, visualize it using various types of charts, and build a machine learning model to predict diabetes outcomes.

2. Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `diabetes.csv`. It contains various health-related attributes and the target variable indicating whether or not a patient has diabetes.

 3.Features

- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age`: Age (years)
- `Outcome`: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating if the patient has diabetes

4. Project Structure

- `diabetes.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the data analysis, visualization, and model training.
- `images/`: Folder to store the generated plots.
- `README.md`: This file.

5. Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you'll need Python and the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
